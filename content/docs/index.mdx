This project is in beta. Follow along on [Github](https://github.com/swellstores/swell-sdk).

Swell UI is intended to make working with e-commerce front-end api's easier. The first supported platform is [Swell](https://swell.is), but we plan to support more.

This project is currently react based, but support for vue and svelte is on the way.

## Third-party UI libraries

Our first supported component library is Radix UI.

We will add support for Headless UI in the future.

## Styling

We use Tailwind CSS for all styling.

## Primitives, Components, and hooks

There are three main parts of Swell UI.

### Primitives

These are the basic building blocks of our UI. Primitives are lightly designed, single use components that are used in together to build our e-commerce components.

### Components

Components are typically made up of multiple primitives to create a component that handles specific use case like product options, product card, or media gallery.

### hooks

Hooks help us interact with our data in an efficient manner. These will be replaced by @swell-sdk in the future.

## FAQs

### What is Swell?

Swell is an api-first e-commerce backend that comes with a no-code database, subscriptions, open checkout, and several other features that help you build 
your future of commerce.

### Why React?

We started with react, but will support many other libraries and tools like vue and svelte in the near future.

### Why Radix UI?

We chose to start with Radix UI because of it's extensive library of accessible and typed components.

Headless UI is on our roadmap.

### Why Tailwind CSS?

We wanted a simple way to allow developers to manage the design of their components.
