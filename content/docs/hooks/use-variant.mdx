  'use client'
  import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
  import { Swell } from "@/lib/swell"

  export const useVariant = (product, options) => {
    // options are an object like { Color: 'Red', Size: 'Small' }
  
    const [variant, setVariant] = useState([]);

    const getVariant = async () => {
      // Resolves the variation price, sale_price, orig_price, and stock_status values based on the customer's chosen options.
      const v = await swell.products.variation(product, options)


      return v
    }

    getVariant().then((variant) => {
      setVariant(variant);
    })

    return variant
  };
